#Tikkun Haklali#
As revealed by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, z"tl.

A fully typeset version of Tikkun Haklali in HTML for easy reading.
The other versions out there on the web are hard to read, and I'm 
a spoiled little Artscroll kid, so I had to do it justice. Sure,
it's not in Artscroll's amazing font, but it should do.

If you'd like to offer corrections and adaptations, please feel free
to fork the repository and make your changes. If they're productive,
I'll happily implement them into the main tree.
